# System Patterns

## Core Architecture

### Pipeline Architecture
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Make["Makefile Targets"]
        B[build]
        T[test]
        P[package]
        D[deploy]
    end

    subgraph Lang["Language-Specific Implementations"]
        CPP[C++ Build System]
        PY[Python Build System]
        C[C Build System]
        PL[Perl Build System]
        F[Fortran Build System]
    end

    B --> CPP & PY & C & PL & F
    T --> CPP & PY & C & PL & F
    P --> CPP & PY & C & PL & F
    D --> CPP & PY & C & PL & F
```

### Component Architecture
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph CI["GitLab CI/CD"]
        Pipeline[Pipeline Execution]
        Runner[GitLab Runners]
        Registry[Container Registry]
    end

    subgraph Build["Build System"]
        Make[Makefile Orchestration]
        Docker[Docker Containers]
        Cache[Build Cache]
    end

    subgraph Deploy["Deployment"]
        Ansible[Ansible Automation]
        Scripts[Bash Scripts]
        Config[Configuration Management]
    end

    Pipeline --> Runner
    Runner --> Make
    Make --> Docker
    Docker --> Cache
    Make --> Scripts
    Scripts --> Ansible
    Ansible --> Config
    Docker --> Registry
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### Build System
1. **Language-Agnostic Interface**
   - Unified Makefile targets abstract away language-specific details
   - Standard targets: build, test, package, deploy
   - Consistent interface across all language implementations

2. **Containerized Execution**
   - Docker-based build environments
   - Reproducible builds across platforms
   - Isolated dependencies per language

3. **Cache Management**
   - Optimized layer caching for Docker builds
   - Artifact caching in GitLab CI
   - Dependencies caching per language

### Pipeline Design
1. **Modular Structure**
   - Template-based pipeline definitions
   - Reusable job configurations
   - Environment-specific overrides

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Language-specific test runners
   - Unified test reporting
   - Coverage tracking

3. **Deployment Process**
   - Environment-based deployment stages
   - Ansible-driven configuration
   - Automated rollback capabilities

## Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern
- Language-specific build implementations behind common interface
- Makefile targets as the factory interface
- Specific build systems as concrete implementations

### Strategy Pattern
- Swappable build strategies per language
- Common build interface
- Runtime selection based on project type

### Observer Pattern
- Pipeline status notifications
- Build event monitoring
- Deployment status tracking

### Facade Pattern
- Makefile as simplified interface
- Complex build operations hidden
- Unified command structure

## Component Relationships

### Build System Integration
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Make[Makefile] --> Lang[Language Detector]
    Lang --> Build[Build Strategy]
    Build --> Docker[Docker Build]
    Build --> Native[Native Build]
    Docker --> Cache[Build Cache]
    Native --> Cache
```

### Deployment Flow
```mermaid

    CI[GitLab CI] --> Make[Makefile]
    Make --> Build[Build]
    Build --> Test[Test]
    Test --> Package[Package]
    Package --> Deploy[Deploy]
    Deploy --> Ansible[Ansible]
    Ansible --> Config[Configuration]
