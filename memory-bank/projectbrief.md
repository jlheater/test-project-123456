## General Guidelines

### Basic Principles
- Use **English** for all code, documentation, and comments.
- Prioritize **modular, reusable, and scalable** code.
- Follow naming conventions:
  - `camelCase` for variables, functions, and method names.
  - `PascalCase` for class names.
  - `snake_case` for file names and directory structures.
  - `UPPER_CASE` for environment variables.
- Avoid hard-coded values; use **environment variables** or **configuration files**.
- Apply **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** principles where possible.
- Always consider the **principle of least privilege** in access and permissions.

### Bash Scripting
- Use descriptive names for scripts and variables (e.g., `backup_files.sh` or `log_rotation`).
- Write modular scripts with functions to enhance readability and reuse.
- Include comments for each major section or function.
- Validate all inputs using `getopts` or manual validation logic.
- Avoid hardcoding; use environment variables or parameterized inputs.
- Ensure portability by using **POSIX-compliant** syntax.
- Use `shellcheck` to lint scripts and improve quality.
- Redirect output to log files where appropriate, separating `stdout` and `stderr`.
- Use `trap` for error handling and cleaning up temporary files.

### Ansible Guidelines
- Follow **idempotent** design principles for all playbooks.
- Organize playbooks, roles, and inventory using best practices:
  - Use `group_vars` and `host_vars` for environment-specific configurations.
  - Use **roles** for modular and reusable configurations.
- Write YAML files adhering to Ansible's indentation standards.
- Validate all playbooks with `ansible-lint` before running.
- Use **handlers** for services to restart only when necessary.
- Apply variables securely:
  - Use **Ansible Vault** to manage sensitive information.
- Use **dynamic inventories** for cloud environments.
- Implement **tags** for flexible task execution.
- Leverage **Jinja2 templates** for dynamic configurations.
- Prefer `block:` and `rescue:` for structured error handling.
- Optimize Ansible execution:
  - Use `ansible-pull` for client-side deployments.
  - Use `delegate_to` for specific task execution.

### GitLab Runner Practices
- Configure runners using **Docker executor** for isolation and reproducibility.
- Use `.gitlab-ci.yml` for pipeline definitions with reusable templates.
- Implement **caching strategies** to optimize build times.
- Configure **concurrent job execution** based on runner capacity.
- Monitor runner health and performance.
- Use **runner tags** to manage specific execution requirements.
- Optimize Docker images for CI/CD jobs.

### Python Guidelines
- Write **Pythonic** code adhering to **PEP 8** standards.
- Use **type hints** for functions and classes.
- Follow **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** and **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** principles.
- Use **virtual environments** or **Docker** for Python project dependencies.
- Implement automated tests using **pytest** for unit testing and mocking libraries for external services.

### GitLab CI/CD Practices
- Leverage GitLab CI/CD with **reusable templates** and **stages**.
- Use **GitLab Container Registry** for Docker image management.
- Implement monitoring via **GitLab metrics** and **logging**.
- Use **GitLab environments** for staging and production deployments.
- Optimize pipeline execution with **directed acyclic graphs (DAG)**.

### DevOps Principles
- Automate repetitive tasks and avoid manual interventions.
- Write **modular, reusable** CI/CD pipelines.
- Use **containerized applications** with secure registries.
- Manage secrets using **GitLab CI/CD Variables** or **HashiCorp Vault**.

### System Design
- Design solutions for **high availability** and **fault tolerance**.
- Use GitLab's built-in features for **event-driven workflows**.
- Secure systems using **TLS**, **IAM roles**, and **network policies**.
- Leverage GitLab's integrated DevOps platform features.

### Testing and Documentation
- Write meaningful **unit, integration, and acceptance tests**.
- Document solutions thoroughly in **markdown** or **Confluence**.
- Use **diagrams** to describe high-level architecture and workflows.

### Collaboration and Communication
- Use **Git** for version control with a clear branching strategy.
- Apply **DevSecOps** practices, incorporating security at every stage of development.
- Collaborate through well-defined tasks in tools like **Jira**.

## Specific Scenarios

### GitLab CI/CD Pipelines
- Use **YAML pipelines** with `includes` for modular configurations.
- Include stages for **build, test, and deployment**.
- Implement **review apps** and **dynamic environments**.
- Configure **deployment freezes** and **scheduling**.
- Use **GitLab Auto DevOps** features where appropriate.

### Docker for GitLab Runners
- Optimize Docker images for CI/CD execution.
- Implement efficient **caching strategies**.

### Bash Automation
- Automate **VM** or **container provisioning**.
- Use Bash for **bootstrapping servers**, **configuring environments**, or **managing backups**.

### Ansible Configuration Management
- Automate provisioning of **cloud VMs** with Ansible playbooks.
- Use **dynamic inventory** to configure newly created resources.
- Implement **system hardening** and **application deployments** using roles and playbooks.

### Testing
- Test pipelines using **GitLab review apps**.
- Write **unit tests** for custom scripts or code with mocking for GitLab APIs.
- Implement **GitLab CI/CD testing stages** efficiently.

## Mermaid Diagrams for Architecture Visualization

### Process

#### Architecture Analysis
- Identify the key components and relationships in the software architecture that need representation.
- Determine which diagram types (e.g., flowcharts, sequence diagrams, ER diagrams) are suitable for representation.

#### Creating Diagrams with Mermaid
- Use **Mermaid syntax** to draft a structured and readable diagram.
- Include clear labels and descriptive annotations to represent relationships between components accurately.

#### Clarifications and Validation
- Ask targeted questions to resolve ambiguities.
- Ensure consistency and avoid contradictory or incomplete information.

#### Output Format
- Provide the **Mermaid code** for the architecture diagram.
- Ensure clear structure and descriptive labels for components and connections.
- Ask targeted questions for any missing or unclear architectural details.

### Best Practices for Mermaid Diagrams
- **Modularity**: Break large diagrams into understandable sections.
- **Consistency**: Use uniform naming for components and connections.
- **Readability**: Apply indentation and comments for clearer code.
- **Accuracy**: Avoid ambiguities and ask questions if unclear.
- **Extensibility**: Structure diagrams for easy expansion.

## Help Designing a Pipeline for C++ and Python Projects

### Pipeline Architecture
The pipeline will support **C++** and **Python** projects, which may also contain additional **C**, **Perl**, and **Fortran** code. Structure repository builds using language-agnostic Makefile targets to standardize CI/CD pipeline execution. Common targets like `build`, `test`, and `package` should abstract away language-specific implementation details (Python, C++, etc.), keeping pipeline templates unified rather than fragmented by language. The build orchestration should occur at the Makefile level rather than in pipeline definitions. Do not write any of the pipline yaml or supporting scripts. Provide instructions on how to setup the pipeline structure and diagrams to explain.
