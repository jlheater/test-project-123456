# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Initial project setup and documentation
- Memory Bank structure establishment
- Core architecture definition

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank structure with core documentation files
- Defined project scope and technical requirements
- Established architecture patterns and diagrams

## Active Decisions

### Build System Design
- Using Makefile as the primary build orchestrator
- Language-agnostic interface for all build operations
- Containerized build environments for consistency

### Documentation Structure
- Mermaid diagrams for architecture visualization
- Markdown-based documentation
- Clear separation of concerns in Memory Bank files

## Next Steps
1. **Build System Implementation**
   - Create base Makefile template
   - Define language-specific build strategies
   - Set up Docker build environments

2. **Pipeline Setup**
   - Configure GitLab CI/CD
   - Set up runner configurations
   - Implement caching strategies

3. **Documentation Expansion**
   - Add specific implementation guides
   - Create troubleshooting documentation
   - Develop contribution guidelines

## Current Considerations
1. **Build System**
   - Balance between flexibility and complexity
   - Cache optimization strategies
   - Cross-platform compatibility

2. **Pipeline Performance**
   - Runner resource allocation
   - Job parallelization strategies
   - Cache effectiveness

3. **Documentation**
   - Keeping diagrams up-to-date
   - Maintaining clear architecture documentation
   - Ensuring comprehensive guides

## Open Questions
- Optimal cache invalidation strategies
- Best practices for multi-language testing
- Environment-specific configuration management
