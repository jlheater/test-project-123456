# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Documenting completed Docker and CI/CD implementations
- Creating migration guides for build system transition
- Updating documentation structure and organization
- Refining developer and build engineer workflows

## Recent Changes
- Completed Docker environment configurations
- Finalized GitLab CI/CD pipeline templates
- Identified need for documentation restructure
- Planned transition to generic make targets (build, test, etc.)
- Developed separation of developer and build engineer guides
- Created comprehensive documentation update plan

## Active Decisions

### Build System Implementation
- Single Makefile per project with generic targets
- Project type specification in .gitlab-ci.yml
- Standardized target names across all projects
- Support for both legacy and new build patterns

### Pipeline Implementation
- Modular CI/CD configuration with template inheritance
- Parallel job execution for improved performance
- Docker-based runner configurations
- Build artifacts and test results management

### Infrastructure Design
- Base image for common tools and utilities
- Language-specific images extending base
- Shared caching strategies
- Standardized environment variables

## Next Steps
1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update foundation documents (README.md, overview.md)
   - Split installation guide into developer/build engineer sections
   - Revise build system documentation for new approach
   - Update Docker and CI/CD documentation
   - Enhance troubleshooting guides

2. **Build System Transition**
   - Document generic make target implementation
   - Create migration guides for existing projects
   - Update CI/CD templates for PROJECT_TYPE specification

3. **Workflow Documentation**
   - Create clear developer guides for day-to-day operations
   - Document build engineer procedures for infrastructure changes
   - Update Docker development workflows

## Current Considerations
1. **Documentation Structure**
   - Separating developer and build engineer concerns
   - Maintaining clear upgrade paths for Python/C++ projects
   - Ensuring comprehensive troubleshooting coverage

2. **Build System Clarity**
   - Making generic targets intuitive
   - Supporting both Make and CMake for C++
   - Handling Python 3.9 and 3.11+ configurations

3. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - Clear distinction between current and new project setups
   - Docker development workflow documentation
   - GitLab runner selection and configuration

## Implementation Insights
- Generic make targets simplify maintenance
- Explicit project type improves pipeline clarity
- Separated documentation enhances usability
- Clear upgrade paths aid project evolution

## Open Questions
- Best practices for transitioning existing projects
- Optimal documentation organization and structure
- Documentation testing and validation procedures
- Timeline for Python/C++ build system updates
