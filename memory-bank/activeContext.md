# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Refining CI/CD pipeline implementation
- Testing and validating build system
- Expanding documentation for implementations

## Recent Changes
- Implemented complete build system with language-agnostic Makefile interface
- Created Docker build environments for base, C++, and Python
- Established modular GitLab CI/CD pipeline structure
- Set up parallel job execution for different languages

## Active Decisions

### Build System Implementation
- Makefile orchestration with common.mk, cpp.mk, and python.mk
- Language-specific build hooks with standardized targets
- Containerized build environments with optimized Dockerfiles

### Pipeline Implementation
- Modular CI/CD configuration with template inheritance
- Parallel job execution for improved performance
- Docker-based runner configurations
- Build artifacts and test results management

### Infrastructure Design
- Base image for common tools and utilities
- Language-specific images extending base
- Shared caching strategies
- Standardized environment variables

## Next Steps
1. **Testing & Validation**
   - Validate build system with real projects
   - Test CI/CD pipeline configurations
   - Verify cross-platform compatibility

2. **Documentation**
   - Create implementation guides
   - Document troubleshooting procedures
   - Update architecture diagrams

3. **Expansion**
   - Add support for C, Perl, and Fortran
   - Implement advanced caching strategies
   - Set up performance monitoring

## Current Considerations
1. **Build System**
   - Testing language-specific implementations
   - Validating target dependencies
   - Ensuring error handling effectiveness

2. **Pipeline Performance**
   - Monitoring parallel job execution
   - Evaluating artifact management
   - Assessing cache performance

3. **Documentation**
   - Implementation details documentation
   - Usage guides for developers
   - Troubleshooting procedures

## Implementation Insights
- Makefile targets provide clean abstraction
- Docker multi-stage builds improve efficiency
- Template inheritance reduces CI/CD complexity
- Parallel jobs improve pipeline performance

## Open Questions
- Performance impact of containerization
- Optimal artifact retention policies
- Cross-project dependency management
- Advanced caching strategies for specific languages
