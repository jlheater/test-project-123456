# Progress Tracking

## What Works
- ✅ Memory Bank structure established
- ✅ Core documentation framework
- ✅ Architecture diagrams created
- ✅ Technical requirements defined
- ✅ Build system architecture designed
- ✅ Project intelligence captured in .clinerules

## In Progress
1. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Implementation guides
   - [ ] Contribution guidelines
   - [ ] Troubleshooting documentation

2. **Build System**
   - [ ] Base Makefile implementation
   - [ ] Language-specific build configurations
   - [ ] Docker build environments

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - [ ] GitLab CI/CD configuration
   - [ ] Runner setup
   - [ ] Caching implementation

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Base Makefile template
- [ ] Docker configuration files
- [ ] Initial CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Basic test framework

### Phase 2: Language Support
- [ ] C++ build integration
- [ ] Python build integration
- [ ] C build integration
- [ ] Perl build integration
- [ ] Fortran build integration

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Caching optimization
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Security scanning
- [ ] Automated documentation

## Known Issues

### Documentation
- None currently - initial setup phase

### Build System
- To be identified during implementation

### Pipeline
- To be identified during implementation

## Upcoming Milestones

### Milestone 1: Initial Setup
- [x] Create Memory Bank structure
- [x] Define architecture
- [x] Document technical requirements
- [ ] Implement base Makefile

### Milestone 2: Basic Pipeline
- [ ] Configure GitLab CI/CD
- [ ] Set up Docker builds
- [ ] Implement basic testing
- [ ] Establish monitoring

### Milestone 3: Language Integration
- [ ] C++ support
- [ ] Python support
- [ ] Additional language support
- [ ] Integration testing

## Performance Metrics
To be tracked:
- Build times
- Test execution times
- Pipeline duration
- Cache hit rates
- Resource utilization
