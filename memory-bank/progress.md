- ✅ Language-specific Docker images implemented
- ✅ GitLab CI/CD pipeline templates established and tested
- ✅ Parallel job execution configured and optimized
- ✅ Build artifact caching strategy implemented
- ✅ Documentation update plan created

## In Progress
1. **Documentation Restructuring**
   - [ ] Foundation documents (README.md, overview.md)
   - [ ] Developer vs Build Engineer guides
   - [ ] Build system documentation
   - [ ] Docker and CI/CD documentation
   - [ ] Troubleshooting guides

2. **Build System Updates**
   - [ ] Generic make target documentation
   - [ ] Project type specification guidelines
   - [ ] Migration guides
   - [ ] Runner selection documentation

3. **Language-Specific Updates**
   - [ ] C++ Make/CMake guidelines
   - [ ] Python 3.9/3.11 setup guides
   - [ ] Build patterns for each language
   - [ ] Testing framework documentation

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Documentation Foundation
- [ ] Update README.md with new build approach
- [ ] Revise overview.md with updated architecture
- [ ] Create separate developer/engineer guides
- [ ] Document generic make target system

### Phase 2: Build System Documentation
- [ ] Generic make target implementation guides
- [ ] C++ build patterns (Make and CMake)
- [ ] Python build patterns (3.9 and 3.11+)
- [ ] Migration guidelines for existing projects

### Phase 3: Advanced Documentation
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configuration guides
- [ ] Docker development workflows
- [ ] Troubleshooting and debugging guides
- [ ] Performance optimization documentation

## Known Issues

### Documentation Structure
- Current docs reflect old build system approach
- Need clearer separation of user roles
- Migration guides needed for build system changes
- Better organization of troubleshooting info needed

### Build System Changes
- Documentation needs update for generic targets
- Clear distinction needed for different build types
- Migration path needed for existing projects

### Documentation Coverage
- AWS/Docker integration details need clarification
- Tool-specific troubleshooting needs expansion
- Performance considerations need documentation

## Upcoming Milestones

### Milestone 1: Foundation Updates
- [ ] Update core documentation structure
- [ ] Implement new build system docs
- [ ] Create role-specific guides
- [ ] Revise architecture documentation

### Milestone 2: Build System Documentation
- [ ] Document generic make targets
- [ ] Create language-specific guides
- [ ] Develop migration guidelines
- [ ] Update CI/CD documentation

### Milestone 3: Workflow Documentation
- [ ] Developer workflow guides
- [ ] Build engineer procedures
- [ ] Docker development documentation
- [ ] Testing and validation guides

### Milestone 4: Finalization
- [ ] Complete troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] Validate all documentation
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Implement final adjustments
